The Atlantic Current pinpoints the locations in Spain with patronage to the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Virgin of Los Remedios. These Marian images garnered fame and devotion in Mexico during the colonial era. This project investigates how Spanish devotion changed in response to these uniquely New World images.

This work relies on the data collected by Jose Antonio Martinez Puche and Rafael del Olmo Veros’ in *María, madre de la Hispanidad: vírgenes patronas de España y América.* This pair located the each site of Marian patronage across Spain. I am using this information as the basis for my map points.
