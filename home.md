title: "Flâneur: A Jekyll theme for maps and texts"
---

> The Atlantic Current pinpoints the locations in Spain with patronage to the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Virgin of Los Remedios. These Marian images garnered fame and devotion in Mexico during the colonial era. This project investigates how Spanish devotion changed in response to these uniquely New World images. 

This site uses [Flâneur](https://github.com/kirschbombe/flaneur), a Jekyll theme using the Leaflet JavaScript library. It was developed by Dawn Childress and ported to Jekyll by Dawn Childress & Dominique O'Neill. It is based on the original [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier) framework developed by Dawn Childress & Nathan Day.
