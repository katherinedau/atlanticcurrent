The Atlantic Current pinpoints the locations in Spain with patronage to the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Virgin of Los Remedios. These Marian images garnered fame and devotion in Mexico during the colonial era. This project investigates how Spanish devotion changed in response to these uniquely New World images.

Feel free to traverse the landscape of Spain, cross the Atlantic to Mexico, and journey back to Spain again, exploring the devotions to these two unique images as you go. I recommend beginning your journey with the [Virgin of Guadalupe in Extremadura]( http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-02-11-guadalupe-extrem/), then travelling to Mexico to explore two devotions there. Finally, return to Spain to draw new parallels between the New World and the Old. Select and deselect categories to trace one image over the other.

This work relies on the data collected by Jose Antonio Martinez Puche and Rafael del Olmo Veros’ in *María, madre de la Hispanidad: vírgenes patronas de España y América.* This pair located the each site of Marian patronage across Spain. I am using this information as the basis for my map points.
