    <h1 class="page-title">Conclusions</h1>
  </header>
    <p>While it is my hope that users of this web map draw their own conclusions about the Virgins of Guadalupe and los Remedios in Mexico and Spain, there is a particular story that I wish to highlight. I hope that I have introduced that story through my <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/">Home</a> and <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/about/">About</a> pages. I would like to conclude it here.</p>

<p>The Virgin of Guadalupe’s history begins in the 12th century with the <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-02-11-guadalupe-extrem/">Virgin of Guadalupe in Extremadura</a>, an image uncovered by a shepherd named Gil Cordero in the Extremaduran region of Spain. This image rose to great prominence in the kingdom, and her monastery the special recipient of patronage from the Spanish crown. She became popular in no small part due to her perceived influence in the expulsion of the Moors from Spain. The Monastery of Guadalupe was the most important Royal patronage site until the construction of the Escorial outside of Madrid.
In 1519, we travel with Hernán Cortés to Mesoamerica to visit the virgins of the New World, <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-03-10-tepeyac-guad/">the Virgin of Guadalupe at Tepeyac</a> and the <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-03-10-naucalpan-rem/">Virgin of los Remedios</a>. One of the soldiers in Cortés’ army brought a small image of the Virgin of los Remedios with him to the New World. After aiding the Spanish as they fled Tenochtitlan, the image was lost for several decades before a native Juan de Tovar rediscovered her under a Maguey cactus. This cactus became incorporated into her iconography.</p>

<p>According to legend, the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared in 1531 to another indigenous man, Juan Diego. After four apparitions, her image imprinted onto the cloak of Juan Diego, and it came to be known as the Virgin of Guadalupe. The image was actually in all likelihood painted by an indigenous painter, Marcos Cípac.</p>

<p>The town of <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-02-11-san-sebastian-de-la-gomera-guad/">San Sebastian de la Gomera</a> in the Canary islands provides another interesting point in the narrative as it shows how devotions to these images might have been established across oceans. The Canary Islands serve as the last piece of Spanish land on the way to the New World and the first coming back. According to this Guadalupe legend, the small statue was found by sailors on their way to the New World. When they built a shrine, it was called Guadalupe for the image of Guadalupe in Extremadura despite little iconographic similarity. Thus, it is unsurprising that an image called Guadalupe in the New World would look so drastically different than the older Extremaduran image.</p>

<p>The recovery of the Mexican Virgins of Guadalupe and los Remedios in Spain begins in Andalucía due to the trade patterns of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Seville remained the only port with access to American commerce from 1503 to 1717. In 1717 this right was transferred to Cádiz, another city in Andalucía.  Because of this monopoly on trade, devotion to the specifically Mexican images primarily grew in this region. Because it was “painted by God,” the image of Guadalupe became iconic. Its spread back to the Old World became much easier to trace because she was reproduced as copies. This can be seen in the small town of <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-02-14-el-algar-andalucia-guad/">El Algar</a>, where the townspeople have emblazoned the image of the Mexican Guadalupe on their crest.</p>

<p>The influence of the Mexican Virgin of los Remedios is very difficult to trace. While the maguey became an identifier, she was by no means solely identified with the maguey. Furthermore, many towns in Spain had devotions to Remedios prior to the growth of her cult in the New World. However, the influence of America can still be seen in locations with patronage to Remedios. Sites like <a href="http://dauk19.wludci.info/atlanticcurrent/#/article/2019-03-09-chiclana-de-la-frontera-andalucia/">Chiclana de la Frontera</a> cite the heavy influence that New World and its riches had on its growth an development.</p>

<p>This web map remains a work in progress and much remains to be explored. Based on my existing research, I have been able to draw new conclusions about the flow of these images and devotions across the Atlantic and back throughout the colonial era.</p>
