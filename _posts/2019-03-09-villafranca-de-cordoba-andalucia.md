According to the legend of this Remedios, she was found by shepherds in the current location of her hermitage. They remained devoted to her through the 17th century, particularly in times of disease or agricultural instability. The Ermita de la Virgen de los Remedios was built in 1731. In the 18th and 19th centuries fervor for the Virgin only increased due to the continued years of drought, flood, and disease.

The image diseapeared from her home during the Spanish Civil War. Don Juan Martínez Cerrillo completed a replacement in 1940. The image was cannonically crowned in 1986.

Villafranca de Córdoba celebrates their patron from September 5-9 each year.
