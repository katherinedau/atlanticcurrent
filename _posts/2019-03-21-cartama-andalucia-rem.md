The current chapel of Remedios replaced a 15th century hermitage. The Virgin supposedly appeared after Ferdinand conquered the town in 1485. The current structure was built in the 17th century.  In 2007, the town established a Museum of Our Lady of Remedies Crowned. This museum holds several dresses belonging to the Virgin. Many of these were made in America and donated to the Virgin.

Citizens celebrate the Virgin of los Remedios in April, when she is processed into the city, where she remains until June. She was canonically crowned on April 28, 2002.
