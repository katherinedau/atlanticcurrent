#### Verified
Located in a Capuchin convent, this representation of the Virgin de los Remedios probably originates in the beginning of the 17th century. She sits on the main altar of the church. There is also a ceramic altarpiece next to the entry to the church.

As legend has it, a shepherd living in the area went to a well to collect water. There, he found a small image of the Virgin, which he put in his bag for his daughter. When he returned home, the image was gone. Gathering water the next day, the shepherd found the image again, and once again she disappeared on his way home. After a third time, the shepherd told the local priest. He determined that they must build a hermitage at "Cerro del Rodeo," close to the well. The Virgin did not like the location and they continued to rebuild until she was satisfied.
