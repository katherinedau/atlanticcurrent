Recorded in 1621 by Friar Luis de Cisneros, the legend of the Virgin of los Remedios begins with the arrival of Hernan Cortes in Mexico in 1519. One of his soldiers brought a effigy of the Virgin of los Remedios, known as a saddle virgin because of its small size, across the Atlantic to the New World. When Cortes' forces entered Tenochtitlan, they placed the image on the altar of the Templo Mayor. Once placed there, no one had the strength to remove it. *La Virgen* remained in the heart of Tenochtitlan until the night of *noche triste,* June 30, 1520. As the Aztecs rose up to expel the Spanish forces from their capital, a fleeing solider grabbed the image. The legend recounts the Virgin of Los Remedios and St. James appearing in the sky to cast dust in the eyes of the Aztecs, allowing the Spanish to flee.

Cortes' forces that made it out of the city spent the night on Totoltec hill. They placed the Virgin of Los Remedios on an altar of a small Aztec temple. She fell under a Maguey and was forgotten for decades. Eventually, a Nahua Cacique, Juan de Tovar discovered the image. His discovery of the image underneath the Maguey subverts the Shepherd's Cycle as he was an indigenous convert rather than a faithful European Christian. After several miraculous appearances, the city council of New Spain built a shrine for Remedios.

Although she resided at her shrine, throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, she was often processed into the capital and kept at the cathedral in times of need. Remedios was thought to be particularly effective against drought, famine, and disease.  

During the 1810 revolt against the crown in Mexico, Fr. Miguel Hidalgo took on the Virgin of Guadalupe as the symbol of Mexico. Always a patron of the Viceroyalty, Remedios came to be associated with the Royalist cause and her devotion subsequently declined. This analysis ignores the fact that indigenous groups remained devoted to her throughout her history and even today.
