The image of Remedios stands on a silver crescent moon in a marble tabernacle-niche inside of the church. This image is on the left of the church when facing the altar. During the civil war, she was hidden in the nearby convent.

The church of Incarnation was constructed in the 18th century by architect Ventura Rodr√≠guez.
