This hermitage lies just under a kilometer outside the town of Paterna del Río. Supposedly, a traveler was bringing the image to Paterna del Río and stopped for a rest. When he was ready to continue his journey, the image became too heavy so the townspeople built a hermitage in that place. Her festival is on second Sunday of May, and on the first Sunday of June, pilgrims take her back to her hermitage.
