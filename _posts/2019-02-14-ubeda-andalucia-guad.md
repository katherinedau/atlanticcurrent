In 1381, a farmer named Juan Martínez discovered this image of the Virgin in Gavellar nearby Úbeda. Although he took her to Úbeda, she often reappeared in Gavellar, where her hermitage remains today.

The people of Úbeda made Guadalupe their patron in 1615. They process the Virgin into the city from her sanctuary on May 1 and place her in the Basílica de Santa María de los Reales Alcázares, where she remains until September 8.

The current image of Guadalupe is not original. She was destroyed in a fire in 1936. She was subsequently replaced with a copy that is still revered today.
